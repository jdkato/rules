  An example of limiting the number of alerts shown.

  category: advanced configuration

  example:

  This is a rule that could trigger a lot of alerts at once, so we limit the
  number reported to only the value of `limit`.

  This is another sentence that contains 'a' and would trigger an alert if not
  for the `limit`.
# You can limit the number of times an rule will be displayed; a value of
# `limit: 1` means that this rule will at most be reported once.
limit: 2
tokens:
  - a
